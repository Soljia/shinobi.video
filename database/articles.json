      "page__content": "<h2>\n    Before Reading\n</h2>\n<p>\n    <i>Please be aware this is all based on my experiences with ZoneMinder.&nbsp;Much of this can be seen as just an opinion. Whether it's a good one or not is up to you.</i>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Firstly, Why does ZoneMinder matter to me?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    <i>I want to make a world class CCTV platform. One that anyone can use. I scoured the internet for months for a place to start and only finding ZoneMinder as the answer over and over. Even my own brother was suggesting it. After using it and studying the code for 2+ years I was met with frustration. Developer arrogance coupled with poorly written code.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n    In short I spent a lot of time and energy on something that didn't work and It frustrated me.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    MJPEG streams are outdated\n</h2>\n<p>\n    With MJPEG you are opening a new stream every time you create an image with an MJPEG url. Even if you remove this element it will continue to eat resources from the server and client. Only way to deal with it currently is through an iframe, popup, or hard refresh.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>Shinobi addresses this with Websocket streams. As frames are captured by FFMPEG they are base64 encoded and sent to the client. Shinobi can also output HLS (m3u8), MJPEG (in an iframe), and JPEG (on a timer).</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n    MJPEG streams are limited in many browsers. About 6-8 Streams maximum. Unless you turn off this limitation in the browsers settings, but of course mobile doesn't normally have this option exposed to users.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>In Shinobi you don't have to worry about that with Bas64 or JPEG streams you can trick the browser into just letting you do it anyway. Base64 is technically using 1 pipe to the client, the Websocket. While JPEG is just refreshing an image on a timer.</i>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    JPEG Storage is awful\n</h2>\n<p>\n    Saving each frame as a separate file in JPEG format can have a seriously detrimental effect on storage space and the hardware itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>Shinobi saves to WebM and MP4 files. While MP4 takes a fair amount of space.. its level of CPU usage during encoding for H.264 streams is just amazing.</i>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Using too many languages\n</h2>\n<p>\n    The platform uses Perl, PHP, JavaScript, C++, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and probably more. This makes it difficult to modify the code for other purposes.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>Shinobi uses JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. Simple right? It should be.</i>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Outdated methods\n</h2>\n<p>\n    While connected to the dashboard it will query the database for events every few minutes, continuously getting/counting the same events over and over.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>Shinobi uses Websockets to get real-time data about Videos and Events.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n    For every camera a new process is created every time a viewer opens a stream. 1 Stream = 1 Process. So if you had 1 Camera with 3 Streams open, you would have 3 processes active for each viewer.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>Shinobi uses 1 process per camera for all viewers.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n    Multiple windows and pages for simple things. For example the monitor settings window. It has multiple pages. Even though each page has a fixed set of options, <b>all inputs are present on the page. They are just hidden.</b> If they were going to do that they may as well have made it use JavaScript to show and hide fields appropriately. Rather than send a request to the server on each page change.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>Shinobi has it all in one window, which is loaded on dashboard load. The fields are populated based on the camera selection. Even then the camera details are stored in the memory of the client browser to easily load data without an additional request to the server.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n    As mentioned previously ZoneMinder uses&nbsp;Perl, PHP and C++. These languages are powerful, no doubt. The issue is in their use. C++ will require building of components, which makes updating a pain. PHP is fully synchronous, which makes client operations a pain for you and for the system it runs on.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>Shinobi uses JavaScript, this allows users to simply overwrite the older Shinobi files with the new ones, restart the processes and you are updated. Since JavaScript is asynchronous and has the ability to pipe data, we are left with little overhead when it actually comes to the node application itself.</i>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Telemetry (Remote User Tracking)\n</h2>\n<p>\n    Quoted from the source code \"This script collects usage information of the local system and sends it to the ZoneMinder development team. This data will be used to determine things like who and where our customers are, how big their systems are, the underlying hardware and operating system, etc.\" - <a href=\"https://github.com/ZoneMinder/ZoneMinder/blob/254fcbcef790c0db11cd845548cd0383b7660e90/scripts/zmtelemetry.pl.in\">ZoneMinder/scripts/zmtelemetry.pl.in</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>You can turn this feature off. Although it should have never been made in the first place or at least turned off by default. From a developer standpoint this a great idea but some people may not like their information being logged somewhere to be possibly stolen then used maliciously. Paranoid? perhaps. All that matters is there are a few who don't want it and may not realize it is there. We don't know if other parts of the code are sending other kinds of data. To even wonder is a bother. Shinobi has no such integration and it never will.</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i>The added issue to this being a third party controls this data. The original author is not the one who stores it. Literally anyone can become a core member of the platform tomorrow and leak all the information 10 minutes after that.</i>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Conclusion\n</h2>\n<p>\n    In less than a year Shinobi has more than half the features of ZoneMinder. I'm not special or trained in programming, I learned at home - in my mom's basement. When someone cares about something they will give their time and effort for that. I care about Shinobi, that is why it has progressed so quickly.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Protect what is precious to you as you live long and prosper.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Learn more about Shinobi on the <a href=\"http://shinobi.video/why\">Why</a> page.\n</p>\n<p>\n    See a comparison of features for&nbsp;<a href=\"/features#learn\">ZoneMinder to Shinobi</a>.\n</p>"

One that anyone can use. Simply login to your account, add camera details, set options, and away you go. No client app installations. Viewing streams and recordings on your mobile device by simply opening a web page.\n</p>\n<p>\n    You should be able to view it on any device with a capable web browser. A base was needed to start with so I took to the internet for more answers.\n</p>\n<p>\n    After much searching one popular CCTV application born in 2003 was the primary choice but found it wasn't capable of fulfilling the role.\n</p>\n<p>\n    To get a detailed outline of the most popular solution check out \"<a href=\"/articles/2017-07-29-why-not-just-use-zoneminder\">Why not just use ZoneMinder</a>\".\n</p>\n<h2>\n    General issues with the present solutions\n</h2>\n<p>\n    You might find the current solutions with a mix of the problems listed below.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Poorly written code\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Missing key features\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Written in obscure or old language\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Ugly interface\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Poor maintenance\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Too expensive\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Not open source\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Requires client to install application\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Does not run on multiple platforms\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>\n    I want to eliminate these issues\n</h2>\n<p>\n    So I started the base of my vision. I worked on it for about 1 week alone in my dark room before I decided to one day pop open the working prototype on my brother's computer. He liked what he saw and asked me \"<b>Is this ZoneMinder?</b>\".. I gave him a big grin and said \"<b>nope</b>\".\n</p>\n<p>\n    I named it how I saw it. Shinobi (Ninja). One who watches from the shadows. Then threw it on Github and began my journey. I never really expected to make a replacement for the current self hosted solutions. It sort of just happened.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    \"So wait.. Shinobi is not what you wanted to make in the first place?\"\n</h2>\n<p>\n    Initially, no. I planned to make a cloud hosted service that would be better and more cost effective than the rest. Something that could be relied upon globally.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Shinobi is meant to be the framework of this platform. As mentioned already, no usable solution existed. So I had to make one from the beginning.\n</p>\n<p>\n    In a sense I have met the criteria of what I wanted to do. I have achieved my goal, just in a different way. It is used around the world and generally it is pretty simple for how powerful it has become.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying the ride\n</h2>\n<p>\n    Shinobi has been an amazing experience so far. I have met amazing people, learned new things and did things I never imagined. The community made it this way. Node.js made it this way. My family made it this way... and so many more.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I am loving every moment that has been and I can't wait to see what's next. Thanks to everyone for helping make Shinobi what it is and what it will become.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Cheers!\n</p>"

You can blame us for being considerate but if there weren't anyone like us then things would be a lot worse.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I too tried to make Shinobi a paid application and it ended with people just wasting my time. Ultimately hurting my performance in maintaining Shinobi.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Take what happened to Nodemailer as a reminder why we shouldn't just take without giving something in return.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Why maintaining without the author is bad\n</h2>\n<p>\n    ZoneMinder is an application where the original author left and look at the result today. For more information check out \"<a href=\"/articles/2017-07-29-why-not-just-use-zoneminder\" target=\"_blank\">Why not just use ZoneMinder</a>\".\n</p>\n<p>\n    Making a program is similar to raising a child. It takes time and effort to do it right.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Please consider contributing to Shinobi to ensure it not only stays alive, so that the code is not destroyed by those not ready to pick up the mantle. This said not referring to ability but to the amount of care and for what purpose.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I am aware that one day I will grow old and die. In that time there will hopefully be someone who cares about Shinobi more than I do to keep it going.. but for now I am in the <b>spring time of youth!</b>\n</p>"

I haven't begun doing it simply by choice. I can monitor the download traffic to Shinobi Pro so if it starts getting crazy with little contribution then things will get <i>legal</i>.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    I don't understand, Can I talk about this somewhere?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    Sure! You can personal message me on Discord or fill out the Contact form with any concerns you may have.\n</p>\n<p>\n    A few users felt it was their duty to post in the Issues section when it was explicitly stated the issues section is only for bugs with the software, Not personal opinions or general discussion. Please don't do this.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    What about previous contributions by other users?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    <b>On the official Contributing page, which is actually linked to from the Github Wiki, it is stated :</b><br><i>\"All contributed code becomes the property of Shinobi. All contributors give permission to Shinobi and Shinobi developers to use the code however it is seen fit. This is agreed upon when making your first commit.\"</i>\n</p>\n<p>\n    I have written this as simple as possible. As much as it is a restricting policy it makes maintaining the application simple. <b>The main premise of Shinobi is to keep things simple even when we are handling something complex.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Don't agree with these rules?</b> Then don't commit or make a pull request to remove your code. Understand though that you have already accepted these guidelines and we reserve the right to reject the request if the code is irreplaceable or needed to function, as the code now belongs to Shinobi. Once a \"reversion request\" is reviewed and accepted we will get into changing the code to not use your specified snippets.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    But isn't the code mine, since I wrote it?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    In your fork it is, that is what the GPL license actually covers. But due to the notice I put on the website anything that is contributed becomes property of Shinobi.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    But you can't just change the License, can you?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    Yes I can actually. I could make the program closed source if I wanted to. I hold that right as the only copyright holder. Its just that all previous versions and any version from CE will not be held under any changes to the license. The copy you have with GPLv3 is always going to be GPLv3.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    How I feel about all this\n</h2>\n<p>\n    I love Shinobi. I want to share it with everyone. That is why I released it for free to begin with... but things have changed. <b>I no longer have the luxury of giving things away. I tried doing a voluntary contribution program but that didn't gain much traction.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n    In the last week I have had a lot of my time wasted with users trying to negate what I have written on the site and have been berated by those who didn't even contribute. <a href=\"/articles/2017-08-01-nodemailer-is-no-longer-maintained\" target=\"_blank\">This happened to the guy who made Nodemailer as well.</a>&nbsp;I work hard on this platform. <b>I didn't pick up a fork and start editing it, I started from line 1.</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Shinobi Pro is a paid application because I want to give back what I have been given and hopefully more.</b>\n</p>"

If a program isn't in the list then I haven't had much time to study it, therefore it is unacceptable to give my opinion of it. <i>Alright enough of that!</i>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Which programs will be mentioned?\n</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Shinobi\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        ZoneMinder\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Blue Iris\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    This article will be updated as more programs are tested.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Which OS would be best for you?\n</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        Windows\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        macOS\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Linux\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    If you chose <b>Windows</b> you can install Blue Iris or Shinobi. The downside to using windows is that there is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and a few desktop-specific services putting extra overhead on the machine.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If you chose <b>macOS</b> you can go for ZoneMinder or Shinobi. Like Windows you have a GUI and extra services putting overhead. Luckily though Mac OS Yosemite is pretty fast even on a Core 2 Duo with 2GB RAM.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If you chose <b>Linux</b> you can go for ZoneMinder or Shinobi and forget the GUI altogether, save that RAM! You can install a minimal version of a well supported Linux distribution like Ubuntu or CentOS. Linux is almost everywhere.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i><b>In short :</b> I would suggest using Linux, specifically&nbsp;Ubuntu Server 17.04, for the best performance over a long period of time.</i>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    What kind of cameras?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    There are generally three types of outputs that we can get from cameras.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        MJPEG (Motion JPEG) - Receiving JPEG data in succession. The old way.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        H.264/H.265 RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) - Receiving MPEG data in a stream. The new way.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        JPEG (Snapshot) - Still frame capture\n    </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Many video management software, including Shinobi, have trouble with MJPEG consumption. If you are stuck with these cameras then you should probably look into using Blue Iris or ZoneMinder. They have done a good job in refining old methods. Though, even then MJPEG causes a lot of issues with ZoneMinder.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If you have cameras with RTSP capabilities then you are in luck. Shinobi and Blue Iris can consume these streams with very little overhead. <a href=\"http://shinobi.video/articles/2017-07-29-how-i-optimized-my-rtsp-camera\">Check out this article for information about optimizing RTSP cameras.</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <i><b>In short :</b> Old cameras are better on ZoneMinder, New cameras are better on Blue Iris or Shinobi.</i>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Got lots of cameras?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    It may be in your best interest to try Blue Iris or Shinobi. Remember though <b>Blue Iris has a maximum of 64 cameras</b> for their Full version. The LE version only allows <b>one</b> camera. Shinobi has no limitation by default. In Shinobi <b>you can set such limitations out of your own choosing</b> in the Superuser panel.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Due to how ZoneMinder is made and maintained there isn't much hope to use lots of cameras unless they are low resolution or using JPEG or MJPEG with low framerate.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Here is a small comparison of <b>H.264 (RTSP)</b> cameras using a mix of <b>copy</b> and <b>libvpx</b> as the Video Encoders. ZoneMinder's MP4 video branch was used for the comparison.\n</p>\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th class=\"text-center\">\n                \n            </th>\n            <th class=\"text-center\">\n                Shinobi\n            </th>\n            <th class=\"text-center\">\n                ZoneMinder\n            </th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td class=\"text-center\">\n                X2 QUAD XEON 2.4 GHZ (8 CORES), 16GB RAM, BAREMETAL\n            </td>\n            <td class=\"text-center\">\n                18 2048x1536 CAMERAS<br>3FPS, ~60% LOAD\n            </td>\n            <td class=\"text-center\">\n                CRASHED AT 15 CAMERAS\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td class=\"text-center\">\n                PENTIUM E5500 2.8GHZ (2 CORES), 3GB RAM, BAREMETAL\n            </td>\n            <td class=\"text-center\">\n                16 2048x1536 CAMERAS<br> 15FPS, 10% LOAD\n            </td>\n            <td class=\"text-center\">\n                CRASHED AT 6 CAMERAS\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td class=\"text-center\">\n                CLOUD X64/X86 SERVER (8 CORES), 16GB RAM, BAREMETAL\n            </td>\n            <td class=\"text-center\">\n                18 2048x1536 CAMERAS<br>3FPS, ~60% LOAD\n            </td>\n            <td class=\"text-center\">\n                NOT TESTED\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>\n    <b>In short</b> : <i>Blue Iris and Shinobi are good for lots of cameras with high resolution and high framerate.</i>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    What is your purpose?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    <b>Personal or Non-commercial use :</b> Shinobi, Blue Iris, and ZoneMinder all fit well in a personal use scenario.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Enterprise or Commercial use :</b> Shinobi, with little restriction and immense power comes great opportunity. Blue Iris is good if you don't need more than 64 cameras or have no issue buying multiple licenses and setting up multiple installations. ZoneMinder is not reliable enough for such scenarios.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Advanced user or not?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    If you are a beginner when it comes to using or installing things like this then it may be best to go for Blue Iris because it is easily installed on Windows.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If you are an advanced user you should look into ZoneMinder if you have time on your hands or Shinobi if you don't really want to mess around too long with the software to get your settings right.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Currently the install processes for Shinobi are not as simple as Blue Iris. ZoneMinder is designed in a way that it requires a decent amount of thought to figure out. Even then the countless bugs left behind almost force you to seek help or self-diagnose.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Do you need support?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    Blue Iris has amazing support. I sent them an email and got a reply within 3 hours. Most companies will take up to 2 or 3 days to respond to an email. Not only that they were kind and straight to the point. I am sure they knew who I was when I emailed them (my account picture is the Shinobi logo) yet they didn't ignore me or give me rude responses.\n</p>\n<p>\n    If you have been in the ZoneMinder IRC or Froum then you would know not much help comes with ZoneMinder. When it does you aren't really sure if they know what is going on. <a href=\"http://shinobi.video/articles/2017-09-01-adding-a-gpu-card-does-it-help\">Here is one article that was written partly because of this problem.</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    As for Shinobi, All I can say is I'll do my best to reply. If I don't know the answer I won't beat around the bush, I will tell you like it is. When Shinobi becomes a large entity, expect that representatives will hold the same level of honesty.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Do you need Open Source?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    If you don't then go with Blue Iris, If you do then go with Shinobi.\n</p>\n<p>\n    Generally, people who care about this are developers. This is why ZoneMinder is not suggested even though it is open source. Essentially, ZoneMinder is just a mess of outdated code. <a href=\"http://shinobi.video/articles/2017-07-29-why-not-just-use-zoneminder\">Read more about it here.</a>\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Conclusion\n</h2>\n<p>\n    <b>Blue Iris</b> is the best choice (in general), <b>for now</b>. 64 cameras is a plenty and support is good. The installation is easy. Camera setup is very human. Self-diagnosis is also easy with all the information about it online. All for $80 CAD is not a bad deal.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Shinobi</b> comes in second. Shinobi only falls short, in my opinion, because of the tedious install process. Essentially, command line is not for everyone. There is a completely free version, <b>Community Edition (CE)</b>, and there is a paid version, <b>Pro</b>. <a href=\"http://shinobi.video/pro\">Learn more about the difference here.</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>ZoneMinder&nbsp;</b>comes in last. it falls short mainly because of how old it is. Using the application takes too much effort, even from advanced users. This program gets most of its popularity from being free and, <b>before,</b> for being the only one of its kind.\n</p>"

      "page__content": "<p>\n    <b>First</b>, docker setup files have a long way to go for ease in setup. I mean writing the files, not using them.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Second</b>, the support provided with docker is less than acceptable. There is no \"everybody gets one\" rule with them. You must pay for support, i get that, but they haven't even updated their app to work with docker (Kitematic, a GUI they made for docker)... if they can't update for their own apps, I can't trust them to update meaningfully in general.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Third</b>, the number of exploits that are found in docker make it not usable for my own purposes, other than testing, so I can't recommend it to anyone else.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-13534/product_id-28125/Docker-Docker.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-13534/product_id-28125/Docker-Docker.html</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Fourth</b>, persistence. I am not sure what the docker devs were thinking when they made the docker image reset itself on reboot... This never actually happened to me but it happened to enough people to be seen as a serious problem. Not only that they have convinced users that it's supposed to be that way.\n</p>\n<p>\n    <b>Of course no application is flawless</b> the problem really is in support. If I have an issue I want to be able to tell myself it will actually get fixed in a reasonable amount of time. A level of implicit trust. This I don't feel with docker, <b>not yet</b>. I am sure in time things will be different. They do have backing from names like NVIDIA.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    Why include the files if i feel this way?\n</h2>\n<p>\n    Many people kept asking about it, so I ended up trying it.. Only to find out Kitematic wasn't updated. I wanted to support Docker and use it for myself. I sort of still do because of how easy it is to use.\n</p>\n<p>\n    But since my attempt at supplying docker in Shinobi a few users have noticed my lack of knowledge when it comes to making these files. They have taken the liberty to either modify or entirely replace portions of the Docker files I included. Thus leaving Shinobi Developers with less knowledge as to how it works than previously.\n</p>\n<p>\n    I will keep docker under consideration because I still use docker myself for <b>testing.</b>&nbsp;It is remarkably easy to use (given the repo owner made a good image). When the Docker team moves things along i'll extend my hand in their favor.\n</p>\n<h2>\n    What to do if you still want Docker\n</h2>\n<p>\n    You have two options.\n</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n        You can head on over to the <a href=\"http://discordapp.com/invite/mdhmvuH/\" target=\"_blank\">community chat</a> and see if anyone there knows a thing or two :) As the Docker files are now mostly a community effort.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        You can use the the <b>kitematic</b> tag. It says that it is old but it updates to the latest master of the Pro repository on start.\n    </li>\n</ul>"
